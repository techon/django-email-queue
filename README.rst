No change in django send_messages usage to get message storing
--------------------------------------------------------------

You don't have to change the way you send messages, this app will plugin into the usual django plumbing.

This way all the email send though django EMAIL_BACKEND will get stored for auditing.


No overhead infrastructure
--------------------------

You don't have to setup overhead infrastructure (e.g. celery, redis and rabbitmq) just to send emails
asynchronously. You can use a simple worker that will send queued emails.

When you get big and having a MQ and all that is a good choice, all you have to to is set
EMAIL_QUEUE_EMAIL_BACKEND to 'djcelery_email.backends.CeleryEmailBackend'.
This way you get message storing for auditing and will use pro setup for asynchronously ran tasks.

Quickstart
----------


Install Django email queue::

    pip install django-email-queue

This is a plugin replacement for your current EMAIL_BACKEND. You'll still use it to send actual messages,
but before them they'll get stored and queued in models visible from admin panel.

.. code:: python

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_email_queue.backends.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_QUEUE_EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_email_queue.apps.DjangoEmailQueueConfig',
    ]

Now you have a few options to setup queue processing

1. Run  `django_email_queue.worker` from terminal to continuously send emails:

.. code:: bash

    python -m django_email_queue.worker

Set EMAIL_QUEUE_SLEEP_TIME to number of settings to sleep between runs.

2. Run django command to process queue and exit:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py send_queued_messages

3. Manually from django admin for :

Running Tests
-------------

Does the code actually work?

::

    $ pipenv install --dev
    $ pipenv shell
    $ tox


We recommend using pipenv_ but a legacy approach to creating virtualenv and installing requirements should also work.
Please install `requirements/development.txt` to setup virtual env for testing and development.
